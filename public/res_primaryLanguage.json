      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Bryce! I just spent the last few months at Codefellows Bootcamp, being taught the proficiencies and skills I will need to become a full-stack software developer. I recently decided to leave my last job, at the Transportation Security Administration where I guarded daily against threats to this nation's transportation systems. I look forward to following my passion to work with computers and computer systems.   I have always been curious about technology. I took apart my first computer and made my first forum by the time I was sixteen. The real reason I got into software development, was because of my family, who were already tech-savvy. My mom and stepdad are tech professionals, and now my brother uses c# and Unity to make games. I want to make systems that bring happiness to others and use my contributions to make a difference. I believe that together, we can solve any issue. ðŸ’œ",
